   - Implement secure registration and login using email and password.
   - Validate user credentials and manage sessions.
2. Real-Time Communication:
   - Integrate WebSocket protocols for instant message delivery.
   - Enable dynamic chat room creation and joining.
3. Private Messaging:
   - Allow users to send one-on-one messages securely.
   - Ensure privacy using unique identifiers for users.
4. Database Integration:
   - Store user information, chat messages, and room details.
   - Maintain chat history for easy retrieval.
5. Frontend Development:
